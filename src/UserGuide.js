                  and emotionally rewarding experience. You're not just saving money - you're mining your 
                  future, one block at a time!

                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p><strong>Q: Where should I start if I'm new to Bitcoin investing?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A: Start with the Goal Planner to create a simple savings goal. Set a modest target 
                  and monthly contribution you're comfortable with. As you gain confidence, you can create 
                  more ambitious goals.

                <p>
                  A: No! All your goals and progress are stored locally in your browser. We never see or 
                  store your financial information. This means your data is completely private, but also 
                  means you'll lose it if you clear your browser data.

                <p><strong>Q: Can I have multiple goals at the same time?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A: Absolutely! You can create and track as many goals as you want. Many users have 
                  separate goals for emergency funds, house down payments, and retirement all running 
                  simultaneously.

                  A: No problem! Simply don't click the "Mine Block" button for that month. You can 
                  catch up later with a double contribution, or adjust your timeline. The dashboard 
                  is flexible to match real life.

                <p>
                  A: Start with "Moderate" (45% annual growth) for balanced projections. Conservative 
                  (20%) is safer for short-term goals, while Optimistic (70%) reflects Bitcoin's 
                  historical best years. You can always recalculate with different scenarios.

                <p><strong>Q: Should I choose "Sell" or "Borrow" for retirement?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  A: It depends on your risk tolerance and belief in Bitcoin's future. "Sell" is simpler 
                  and safer but depletes your Bitcoin over time. "Borrow" preserves your Bitcoin but 
                  requires careful management and involves debt. Many retirees use a combination.

                  A: Currently, goals can't be edited once created. If your situation changes significantly, 
                  you can delete the old goal and create a new one with updated parameters.

                  A: These are mathematical projections based on your chosen growth rates. Bitcoin's actual
