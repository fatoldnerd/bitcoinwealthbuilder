## Getting Started: Your Financial Journey

Your path to Bitcoin wealth building is surprisingly straightforward, and it begins with just two simple steps:

### Step 1: Create a Plan
The best place to start your journey is with our **Goal Planner**, where you can create a personalized plan for any major life goal. Whether you're saving for a house down payment, planning a dream vacation, building an emergency fund, or working toward any specific financial target, the Goal Planner helps you map out exactly how Bitcoin can help you get there.

Simply enter your goal, choose your timeline, decide on your monthly contribution, and let our tool show you the potential path forward. You'll see clear projections, interactive charts, and understand exactly what it takes to reach your target.

### Step 2: Track Your Progress  
Once you've created a plan that excites you, you can save it to your personal **My Dashboard** where the real magic happens. Your dashboard transforms your financial journey into an engaging, gamified experience using Bitcoin's own "proof-of-work" concept. 

Each month, you'll return to your dashboard to track your contributions and "mine the next block" in your personal blockchain journey. It's financial planning that actually feels rewarding and motivating!

## "My Dashboard": Your Personal Progress Tracker

Your Dashboard is where Bitcoin Wealth Builder truly shines, transforming the often tedious process of tracking financial progress into an engaging, gamified experience that leverages Bitcoin's own revolutionary concepts.

### Saving Your Plans

After creating a plan in either the Goal Planner or Retirement Calculator, you'll see a prominent **üöÄ Start My Plan** button appear below your results. Clicking this button saves your plan to your personal dashboard, where you can track your progress over time.

When you click "Start My Plan," you'll be prompted to give your plan a memorable name (like "House Down Payment 2026" or "Early Retirement Fund"), and then your plan becomes part of your personal dashboard ecosystem.

### Understanding the "Proof-of-Work" Metaphor

Your Dashboard uses Bitcoin's fundamental concept of "proof-of-work" to make your financial journey both meaningful and motivating. Here's how the metaphor works:

#### **Your Hash Rate = Your Monthly Contribution**
In Bitcoin mining, hash rate represents computational power‚Äîthe more hash rate you have, the more likely you are to successfully mine blocks. In your financial journey, your "hash rate" is your monthly contribution. The more you contribute each month, the more "computational power" you're dedicating to reaching your goal.

#### **The Goal Difficulty = Your Final Target Amount**  
Just as Bitcoin's network automatically adjusts mining difficulty, your goal has its own "difficulty level" represented by your target amount. A $50,000 house down payment has a different difficulty than a $2 million retirement fund, and your dashboard reflects this proportionally.

#### **The Blockchain = Your Visual Timeline**
Your progress is displayed as an actual blockchain‚Äîa series of connected blocks that represent your journey over time. Each block represents a month in your plan, and as you complete months by making your contributions, you'll "mine" new blocks and watch your personal blockchain grow.

This isn't just a cute visual metaphor‚Äîit's a powerful way to understand that building wealth, like Bitcoin itself, requires consistent, sustained effort over time. Each monthly contribution is proof that you're doing the work necessary to secure your financial future.

### The Monthly Ritual: Mining Your Next Block

The heart of your Dashboard experience is the monthly ritual of returning to update your progress. Here's how it works:

**Each month, you:**
1. **Make your planned Bitcoin purchase or contribution**
2. **Return to your Dashboard**
3. **Click the ‚õèÔ∏è "Mine Next Block" button** for that goal
4. **Watch your blockchain grow and your progress advance**

This simple monthly action serves multiple purposes:
- **Accountability**: Regular check-ins keep you committed to your plan
- **Motivation**: Watching your blockchain grow provides visual satisfaction
- **Progress Tracking**: You always know exactly where you stand
- **Habit Building**: Monthly dashboard visits reinforce positive financial habits

### Dashboard Features and Visualization

Your Dashboard displays each of your saved goals as its own "mining operation," complete with:

- **Visual Blockchain**: See your progress as actual blocks in a chain
- **Progress Percentage**: Clear indication of how far you've come
- **Time Remaining**: Know exactly how many more "blocks" you need to mine
- **Goal Status**: Track whether you're on target, ahead, or behind schedule
- **Hash Rate Display**: Your monthly contribution amount prominently shown
- **Completion Celebration**: Special recognition when you've successfully "mined" your entire goal

The dashboard is designed to make checking your progress genuinely enjoyable‚Äîsomething you'll actually look forward to each month rather than a chore you avoid.
